# Water-Level-Detection-Using-LDR
The phototransistor is a three-layer semiconductor device which has a light-sensitive base region.
The base senses the light and converts it into the current which flows between the collector and the emitter region.
The presence or absence of water alters the intensity of light reaching the phototransistor, causing a measurable change in its output current.
The difference in light intensity, caused by the presence or absence of water, leads to a variation in the ADC value. This change in ADC value can be utilized as a parameter to measure the water level.
